python notes
===============================
1) stages :
Data type & operators
Data Structure
Control flow
Functions
Scripting
Module = is the access of any other code.
two type of module:
1)Built in module.
2)External Module 

python is the interpreter language 

write python on CMD & terminal , so to open / enterd REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop)

"\n" is the line breake

print() is the built-in-function in python

# , ''' ''' , """  """ are use to comments and used for comment is ctl + / (forward slach)

\" content \" it's backslash content inwhich you write anything in this qutution

DATA TYPE 

1)String === it's represent is " ".
2)Integer/Number === it's represent is only numbers in which single number, decimals etc.
In this data type more types of integer.
1. Numeric/Integer.
2.Float. === 1.2 , 2.5345,so own. basically in  this type of integer we are use decimals.  
3.Complex. === if we used to complex data type of integer so we used to built-in-function which is complex() and inside the 
function we entered those number which is complex.
3)Boolean === in which we used True or False for the condition.
4)Mutation === in this mutation is like array & array in the array. and mutation also changed it's mean mutaion means changedable thing.
it's represent is [].For example : [123, 2.562, "say hi",true, ['lion', "birds" , "etc"] ]
5)Inmutation === is not changeable thing. it's represnet is (). For example : ((123, 2.562, "say hi",true), ('lion', "birds" , "etc") ).behave is like object.
6)Mapped data === is like object and represent is {}.in this key values work for example : "name":"hi", etc and key values in string and also accept all type of data 
 
 


type() we are  using for check any datatype  so we used to type().

ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:
+ === addition === 5+3.
- === subtract === 5-3.
* === multiplication === 5*3.
/ === division === 5/3.
** === exponational === 5**3. it's mean 5x5x5.
// === floor division === 5//3.it's mean 2.5 and i used // so output is 2 and reduced pointes all value. 
% === modulus === 5%3.


TYPECASTING :

Two type of typecasting.
1) Explicit conversion (Explicit type casting in python).
            In Explicit conversion this function are included ins(),float(),hex(),oct(),str()etc. Basically this conversion is convert in to
this function like string number convert into integer , float or integer convert into string etc. 
2) Implicit conversion (Implicit type casting in python).


Taking User Input:
input() input by default as a string behave. if you taking a number from user from input so input give you by default string as such JavaScript    
so then we are convert input into integer by using int() or float()

String are immutable in python langiage

Lenght of string:
len()
# String method

name="suffiyan"
name2="ahmed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
name3="ahmed"
name4="hi hello  world"
name5="weLBUidewnufci76942"
name6="hi Hello  wOrld80294"
name7="     "
print(name.upper())
print(name.lower())
print(name2)
print(name2.rstrip('!')) # removes any trailing characters
print(name3.replace("ah","kh"))
print(name4.split(" ")) # convert  string into list
print(name4.capitalize()) 
print(name3.center(100)) 
print(name3.count("ahmed")) 
print(name2.endswith("!")) 
print(name4.endswith("lo" ,0,8)) 
print(name4.find("lo")) # if find method are worked so it's return index number
print(name4.find("to")) # and if no any thing in find method so it's return -1 which mean's false
print(name4.index("lo")) # if index number are not available to givin string so it's return a error which error is "valueError: substring not found"
print(name5.isalnum()) # if have A-Za-z0-9 are available in string without spacing so return ture otherwise it's return false
print(name6.isalnum()) 
print(name6.isalpha()) # if have A-Za-z are available in string without spacing so return ture otherwise it's return false and also number in the string so also return false
print(name3.isalpha()) # if have A-Za-z are available in string without spacing so return ture otherwise it's return false and also number in the string so also return false
print(name4.islower()) # it's check that if all characters are lowercase so return true otherwise false
print(name6.isprintable()) # if it's printable so return true otherwise false return
print(name7.isspace()) # if space are available in the string so return true otherwise false
print(name3.istitle()) # it's check if first letter are capital so return true otherwise false
print(name4.startswith("hi")) # it's check if first letter are available so return true otherwise false
print(name4.swapcase()) # if  uppercase string is so convert into lowercase and lowercase is so convert into upercase  
print(name4.title()) # it's convert to title means every first letter are capitale
